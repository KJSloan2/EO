# EO - Earth Observation Tools for Land Analysis

EO is a toolkit of earth observation tools for spatial and temporal analysis. Please note, this is a personal project and is in progress. This toolkit is being developed the streamline the acquisition, preprocessing, spatial and temporal analysis of multispectral raster data from the USGS's Landsat 8 and 9 missions. The toolkit also incorporates other spatial features such as slope, elevation, catalogued features (water bodies, land formations,  forests, built structures etc.), and socioeconomic and demographic data such as population,  income and various other indicators. The intent of this project is to provide  comprehensive descriptions of land characteristics and changing land dynamics over time. An example of this toolkit's usage may be to determine the suitability of land for purposes like homesteading or small scale farming by analyzing how land surface temperature and vegetation health have changed in an given area over time and if terrane characteristics such as topography are suitable for the intended land use.

## Landsat/3DEP and Data Aquisition with Earth Engine

Landsat is a continuous series of earth observation satellite missions conducted through a joint effort between the USGS and NASA, going back to the 1970s. Earth observation data from the Landsat missions constitutes the larges and most comprehensive data collection of moderate resolution multispectral data, which as of 2008, is available to the public for "free" (if you live in the U.S. you technically pay for it with your taxes). Landsat moves in a sun-synchronous orbit around the earth to capture daylit imagery. The imagery is captured and processed (orthographically rectified, radiometrically calibrated etc.) by the USGS and made available to the public within a matter of weeks from acquisition in either tier 1 or tier 2 collections. In this project, I use tier 1 data because it provides better quality than tier 2, especially for multi-temporal analysis. I use Earth Engine to tap into the Landsat imagery collection and perform basic preprocessing steps such as creating composite imagery with cloud cover and shadows removed and top of atmosphere conversion from digital numbers. Once acquired and preprocessed, the imagery is exported as a geo-referenced GeoTiff. This is done for all years in the analysis period,  providing a single composite image for each year of the analysis.

### 3DEP Elevation Data
Earth Engine is also used to acquire elevation from the USGS 3DEP 10m National Map Seamless (1/3 Arc-Second) collection. 3Dep elevation data is preprocessed with local Python tools in this repo and integrated with Landsat data to map land surface temperature and vegetation data to 3D points (Lat, Lon, Elv) rather than just 2D (Lat, Lon) points.

### Spatial Resolutions
Landsat 8 optical data from the OLI is 30 meters spatial resolution, Landsat 8 TIRS data is 100 meter spatial resolution and 3DEP elevation data is 10.2 meter spatial resolution. To reconcile different spatial resolutions between these data, special spatial aggregation functions were implemented in the band preprocessing tools. See documentation for bandPreprocessing.py for more information.
