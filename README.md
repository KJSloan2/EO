EO is a toolkit of earth observation tools for spatial and temporal analysis. Please note, this is a personal project and is in progress. This toolkit is being developed the streamline the acquisition, preprocessing, spatial and temporal analysis of multispectral raster data from the USGS's Landsat 8 and 9 missions. The toolkit also incorporates other spatial features such as slope, elevation, catalogued features (water bodies, land formations,  forests, built structures etc.), and socioeconomic and demographic data such as population,  income and various other indicators. The intent of this project is to provide  comprehensive descriptions of land characteristics and changing land dynamics over time. An example of this toolkit's usage may be to determine the suitability of land for purposes like homesteading or small scale farming by analyzing how land surface temperature and vegetation health have changed in an given area over time and if terrane characteristics such as topography are suitable for the intended land use.
